# Kraken #

Kraken is a WordPress theme built with Bootstrap. It features easy customization for the user by providing a Theme Options page, yet also prioritizes performance and user experience concerns.

## Versions 1.0.1 ##

- Fixed a bug with the slogan overflowing its container on smaller viewports
- Allowed horizontal scrolling (in case users on mobile devices zoom in)
- Concatenated JavaScript files for better performance
- Renamed `bootstrap.scss` into a Sass partial for faster Sass processing

### Kraken 1.0.0 ###

The first version, released when Kraken was production ready.
